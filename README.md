## Problem Statement

Job hunting today is fragmented and inefficient, causing frustration and wasting time for both job seekers and employers. Job seekers often find it difficult to access comprehensive resources for interview preparation and encounter outdated and inaccurate job listings. Employers face challenges in managing job listings and assessing candidates effectively. There is a dire need for a unified platform that simplifies this process for both parties.

## Problem with Existing Solutions

Current platforms are plagued with outdated job listings and lack direct resume verification services.
